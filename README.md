# Coroutines in C

Implement Coroutines in C as a learning exercise.

Currently, this only works on Linux as it uses `io_uring` for async I/O.

### Requirements
1. cmake >= 3.0
2. clang
3. Linux kernel version > 5.1

### Build instructions
Clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules <url>`
Run `build.sh` in the repository root.
